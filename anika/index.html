                <p>Hello! My name is Anika and I am a rising third year undergraduate student at UCLA pursuing a degree in Cognitive Science with
                a Specialization in Computing. My research interests include socio-communicative deficits in children diagnosed with autism (ASD),
                acquired neurological memory disorders, and secondary language acquisition. Currently, I work as a research assistant at the UCLA
                Language Acquisition Lab, where I conduct literature review and facilitate storytelling and sing-along sessions with infants and 
                young children. Furthermore, I work in the Vision Lab under the guidance and counsel of post-doctoral fellow, Dr. Yi-Chia Chen, on 
                visual aesthetics and web design. Post-graduation, my dream is to pursue a doctorate degree, become a licensed neuropsychologist, 
                and work with underpriveleged children in a clinical capacity. In my free time, I enjoy visiting libraries and bookshops, cooking 
                a variety of cuisines, hiking and playing fetch with my sweet pup Mylo, and binge-watching Netflix.
